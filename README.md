# Migraine Classification Using Machine Learning
## Project Review
This project focuses on the application of advanced machine learning techniques to classify and predict migraine episodes based on various clinical features. Migraines are a complex neurological condition characterized by recurrent headaches, often accompanied by nausea, light and sound sensitivity, and in some cases, visual disturbances known as aura. The condition impacts millions of people worldwide, and its triggers and symptoms can vary widely among individuals.
The study employs state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, including both traditional models (Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees) and advanced models (Deep Neural Networks and ensemble methods). The ultimate goal of the project is to improve the accuracy of migraine classification, offering insights that could lead to personalized treatment strategies for patients.
## Algorithms Employed
### 1. **Traditional Machine Learning Models**:
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Random Forest (RF)**
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Decision Trees (DT)**
- **Deep Neural Networks (DNN)** <br/><br/>
These models were tested on migraine-related data to identify patterns in migraine episodes. Among them, the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model showed the highest accuracy due to its ability to capture complex relationships in the dataset.
### 2. **Ensemble Models**:
- **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)**
- **Stacking**
- **Voting**
### 3. **Boosting Models**:
- **AdaBoost**
- **Gradient Boosting**
- **Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT)**
## Data Augmentation
Data augmentation techniques, such as **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**, were applied to balance the dataset, particularly when dealing with class imbalances (e.g., a higher frequency of certain migraine types).
## Results
The implementation of ensemble methods, particularly **Voting** and **Gradient Boosting Classifiers**, resulted in a substantial improvement in accuracy, reaching **99.66%** when augmented data was used.
These findings suggest that leveraging ensemble and boosting techniques, alongside data augmentation, can lead to more robust and accurate classification models for migraine prediction.
## Key Findings
- **Deep Neural Networks (DNN)** exhibited high accuracy in predicting migraine episodes, thanks to their ability to capture complex data patterns.
- **Ensemble methods**, including Bagging, Stacking, and Voting, significantly improved the classification accuracy of migraine types.
- **Boosting models** (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and GBDT) further refined the classification, reducing errors and enhancing predictive reliability.
- **Data augmentation** played a critical role in improving model performance, especially for classifiers sensitive to class imbalance.
The use of these techniques underscores the importance of integrating machine learning approaches to enhance diagnostic accuracy and promote personalized treatment strategies in healthcare settings.
## Future Directions
Further research could include:
- Integration of **longitudinal data** and **unstructured data sources** (e.g., patient notes, imaging data) to further improve model reliability.
- Development of more **personalized treatment plans** based on patient-specific data and triggers, potentially improving patient outcomes.
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of advanced machine learning techniques, particularly ensemble and boosting models, in enhancing migraine classification accuracy.
The findings highlight the value of precise and reliable predictive models for clinical applications, offering a promising path toward improved patient care and treatment outcomes.
